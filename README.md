## Features

- **Efficient Data Transfer:** Optimized for minimal bandwidth usage and low-latency communication.
- **Reliability:** Implements error detection and correction mechanisms to ensure reliable data transmission.
- **Scalability:** Designed to accommodate a growing number of devices in a network.
- **Flexibility:** Adaptable to various communication scenarios and use cases.

## Installation

To use the CHIRP Communications Protocol in your project, follow these steps:
Using SSH:  
`git clone git@github.com:Hover-Disaster/Strelka_Ground_Station_Packets.git`  
Using HTTPS:  
`git clone https://github.com/Hover-Disaster/Strelka_Ground_Station_Packets.git`  

## Usage
### Packet encoding:  
1. Define payload struct and fill with relevent data
2. Define meta data fields
3. Fill buffer with data
4. Calculate 32-bit CRC
5. Transmit data  
### Packet decoding:
1. Receive incoming data into buffer
2. Check identifier field and determine payload data length using look up table
3. Calculate 32-bit CRC and verify packet is not corrupted
4. Check receiver ID, sender ID and protocol version
5. Decode payload data into struct corresponding to packet type
